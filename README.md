This repository includes the three old school video games I created in high school, in Python. 

These video games include Pong, Space Invaders, and Asteroids.

In order to quickly run these games, drop the downloaded game files into the "Pygame Pictures" folder, and then run them.

NOTE: In order to run, you must be running Pygame 2.7 for 32-bit machines, and Python 2.7 for 32-bit machines. Otherwise, there is a high chance these programs
WILL NOT WORK

In order to learn the Pygame Library, I followed Al Swegart's Pygame Programming Guide.

HOW TO PLAY:

PONG:
W and S keys to move up and down for player 1. Up and Down keys for Player 2. First to 10 goals win.

SPACE INVADERS:
Shoot with space bar, move with arrow keys. Kill all aliens before aliens hit the bottom.

ASTEROIDS:
Left and Right keys to control direction, up key to move forward. Space to shoot. Destroy all asteroids.
